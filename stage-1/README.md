## Brief

You are working as part of an insurance company as an engineer.
Customer Support has just identified a problem with one of our service applications. For an unknown reason, our latest customers between ages 40 and 59 have paid an incorrect amount for their insurance products.

We need to identify the affected customers and notify Customer Support with the customer's name, phone number and email address inside a .txt file.

There is a list of our latest customers [here](./latest-customers.txt)

Please write a function in your chosen language to produce the .txt file.

Once complete, create a feature branch, commit your created .txt file, your solution, and push this repository to your own Github profile, raise a pull/merge request, finally send Customer Support (ClearRoute hiring manager) the URL.

Please do not raise a pull request against our original repository!
